# The Economist Data Team's Grid/Tile Choropleth Map
Recreating The Economist's Grid Choropleth Map in {ggplot2}

## Motivation 

I am a huge fan of The Economist's [data team](https://www.economist.com/topics/graphic-detail). Their iconic design and elegant approaches to data visualization are extremely flexible, easily translating between print columns, online, and social (especially [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/theeconomist/)). One of my favorite visualizations is The Economist data team's effective  grid tile choropleth map for the 50 states and DC.
